# My Portfolio Website

Repository for my website, where I showcase my latest work from Software Coursework or Personal Portfolio projects.
You will also find the latest results from my rallying as a co-driver.

The site was also a chance to get to grips with NextJS v13, as well as Tailwind CSS.
I haven't had a chance to really explore the potential of NextJS with this project yet, but future updates will likely include the use of a database and utilise NextJS's new API routing capabilities.

## Site Goals

### Main Objectives:
    1. Have a means to display Software Projects
    2. Have a means to display latest Rallies
    3. Have site visitors be able to contact me via a form
    4. Site visitors have access to my social media via icons
    5. Intuitive navigation and traversing of the site
    6. Latest CVs are displayed on a dedicated page
    7. Work with NextJS v13 and Tailwind CSS
    8. Set up plans for future updates and features


## Features

On the site is constructed in 2 ways, where you are able to navigate to anyway from either method.
The landing page allows users to scroll up and down vertically to access the desired information that is brief and gets to the point with call-to-action buttons in each respective section, and for a more streamlined and decidicated look at different pages there is a tradition navbar at the top of the site which will take you to the specific pages on the site.

NEXTJS Starter information
--------------
<br/><br/> 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
